## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Atom


### What I learned

This challenge helped refresh my memory of HTML5 and CSS. I understood these languages awhile back but without practice, you begin to fall behind in your understanding.

I did learn how to round the curves of a div using CSS. (border-radius:15px;)



### Continued development

I want to become confortable with my HTML and CSS capabilites. It should become my foundation for everything and hopefully my google searches decrease. I also want to advance my knowledge in javascript.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Rounded Corners](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) - This helped me with rounding the corners of my divs. I like the way w3schools explained it , very simple and straight to the point.
